# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project consist in gathering the data of high schools and performing an analysis on total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse how replacing inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School impacts the overall data analysis.

## Results
Most of the metrics from the original analysis remained the same. 

This is due to the fact that there was a large set of data, and removing a small portion of the data, for math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School, would not change the data significantly. 

Below is the table from the first analysis, which includes math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

Below is the table from the second analysis, where the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School were removed.

The only differences are the averages and percent passing at Thomas High School. 

Even with the removal of certain data, the overall results remained fairly the same.

## Summary
The four main changes were observed on the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. 

With the removal of the 9th graders data, the count of total students overall and total students at Thomas High School decreased. This lead to a change in average scores and score percentages. 

Taking into consideration that the score and percentage changes were minimal, we can conclude that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School was not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
